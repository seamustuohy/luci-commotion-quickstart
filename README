commotion-quick-start
=====================

A quick start interface for commotion OpenWRT routers.

This package will work as such.


1) A main_view quick-start(qs) page is called running any functions assigned to it.
1a) The main qs page calls a header section, passing it any value(s)
1b) The main qs page calls a main section, passing it any value(s)
1c) The main qs page calls a set of buttons [button(text, image, action)]
1d) The main qs page is viewed

2) A Button is clicked
2a) That button makes a call to a function in the controller designated by the buttons action.
2b) That function runs, and completes by displaying another main_view which starts the process over again.

This will allow for any modification of any UX path to be done in the controller without messing around with the views. All modeling will be done withing the "sections." As such, if a CBI model is called it will be embedded within the main section of some main_view. This will allow for buttons to make UCI calls as well as load templates.
